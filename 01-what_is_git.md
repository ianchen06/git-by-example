# What is Git?

## Overview
In this lecture, we will introduce Git, a powerful tool for version control and collaboration when working with text files. Git allows you to track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and efficiently manage your project's history. We will explore what Git is, its key concepts, and how it is used for text files.

## Definition

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track and manage changes to your code or any text-based files. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become an essential tool for developers and anyone working with text files.

## Key Concepts

1. **Collaboration**: Git facilitates collaboration on software development and other text-based projects. Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Git enables easy merging of changes and helps resolve conflicts.
1. **Version Control**: Git tracks changes to files over time. It allows you to view and revert to previous versions of your project, which is crucial for maintaining a stable and error-free codebase.
1. **Commit SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)**: Each change made to your project is recorded in a commit. Each commit is uniquely identified by a cryptographic hash called a commit SHA. The commit SHA is based on both the order and content of the changes. This ensures that no two commits can have the same SHA, making it impossible to tamper with or lose project history.
1. **For Text Files Only**: Git is designed for tracking changes in text-based files, such as code files, documentation, configuration files, and more. It's not suitable for binary files like images or videos.
